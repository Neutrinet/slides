# Solution

* Refuse new members? Nope, it sucks
* So...

# Let's make a Federation \o/

---

# In 2011 the Federation FFDN<br>(or FFDN) is launched

---

# The Federation FDN

# At that time

* 7 ISP (Aquilenet, FDN, Franciliens.net, Ilico, Lorraine Data Network (LDN), Sames Wireless and tetaneutral)
* creation of a chart for joining (basically the principles of FDN: net neutrality, non profit, no employees, no subscribers but members, associative, democratic etc...)
* Strategy of that time was making local ISP (centered around big Towns or regions)
* Some new technologies introduced by members: Wifi, plans for fiber

* Some new technologies introduced by members: Wifi, plans for fiber

# Advantages

* Human size again
* Local (so better suited for local problems for example "white zones")
* Decentralized -> harder for the government to control (censorship with 4 big ISP != censorship with zillion of ISP)
* Members are very easily able to offer DSL access thanks to FDN backhaul contract (they can resell it under their name)

---

# The Federation FDN - Today

* 26 ISP - 2105 members (including 1288 members with a subscription) and growing fast!
* Politically engaged: a **lot** of legal recourses against stupid action of the French government (and there are many)
